# Perfect Tables: Expanded Styles
This CSS snippet enhances standard Markdown tables in Obsidian with modern, visually appealing styles. It goes beyond a single look by introducing conditional classes that allow you to adapt your table's appearance to its content and context.

# Features
Base Perfect Table: A default, clean, and professional style for all Markdown tables, with subtle borders, zebra striping, and a gentle hover effect.

Compact Tables: A space-saving style for dense data, reducing padding and font size without sacrificing readability.

Latex-Style Tables: A minimalist, academic style that removes box shadows and most borders for a clean, formal presentation.

Highlighted Columns: A class to highlight the first column, perfect for drawing attention to key identifiers like item names or dates.

Dataview Integration: Specific styles to improve the visual consistency of tables generated by the popular Dataview plugin.

# How to use
## Installation
Open Snippets Folder: In Obsidian, go to Settings > Appearance.

Navigate to Snippets: Under the "CSS snippets" section, click the folder icon to open the snippets directory.

Add the Snippet: Download the perfect-tables-expanded.css file from this repository and place it in the snippets folder.

Enable the Snippet: Return to the Appearance settings in Obsidian, click the "Reload snippets" button (the refresh icon), and toggle the perfect-tables-expanded snippet on.

## Applying Styles with cssclasses
To use the conditional styles, you must add the appropriate cssclass to the top of your note in the frontmatter. You can use multiple classes by separating them with a space.

```yaml
cssclasses:
- compact-table
- highlight-first-column
```

### Base Table
All standard tables will automatically receive this style.

### Compact Table
This is ideal for tables with many columns or that contain dense information.
Add `cssclasses: compact-table` to your note's frontmatter.

### Latex-Style Table

This style provides a minimalist, academic look without strong box shadows or borders, perfect for formal documents.
Add `cssclasses: latex-table` to your note's frontmatter.

### Highlighted Column Table

This is great for tables where the first column acts as a key or identifier, making it stand out from the rest of the data.
Add `cssclasses: highlight-first-column` to your note's frontmatter.

### Combined Styles

You can combine multiple table styles by listing them in your frontmatter. For example, to make a compact table with the first column highlighted:

```yaml
cssclasses:
- compact-table
- highlight-first-column
```

# Customization

- **Change colors:** Modify the var(--...) color variables to match your theme or personal preference.

# Troubleshooting
